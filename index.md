## About Me:

Hey there! I’m **Sakshee**, a curious mind with a passion for blending creativity and cutting-edge tech. Currently pursuing my master’s in [Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.meng.duke.edu/degree) at Duke University, my journey in AI began back in my freshman year and has been anything but ordinary since. I’ve delved into research in computer vision and robotics, applying these innovations to fields like agriculture and manufacturing. Before starting my master’s, I was at Deloitte, where I embraced the challenge of building Generative AI solutions, staying at the forefront of technology. My excitement peaks when I’m working in an industry research and development team, turning ideas into impactful realities.

Whether in the lab or the fast-paced world of industry, I’m driven to create technology that empowers, excites, and elevates everyday life—and I’m just getting started!
